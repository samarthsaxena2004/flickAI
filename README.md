## The "Why" (Our Story)

We've all been there: you're debugging a cryptic error, or staring at a blank email draft, and you have to context-switch. You alt-tab to a browser, copy-paste your code/text into ChatGPT, only to lose your flow.

**We built FlickAI because we wanted an assistant that lives *with* us, not in a browser tab.**

We didn't want another chatbot. We wanted a "tap-on-the-shoulder" companion — something that wakes up instantly, looks at our screen, and says "I see what you're working on, here's the fix."

With just two of us and 24 hours, we set out to build exactly that — a native OS-like experience that feels like magic.

## The Cerebras & Cline Experience

This project wouldn't have been possible in this timeframe without our core tech stack. Here's what we learned:

### Cerebras GLM-4.7: "It feels instant"

The biggest bottleneck for desktop assistants is usually latency. Waiting 5–10 seconds for a response breaks the magical "assistant" feeling.

- **What worked**: We plugged in Cerebras GLM-4.7 and were blown away. The token generation is so fast that the answer often appears before we finish blinking.
- **The Trick**: We streamed the response directly to our "Message Bubble" component. Because Cerebras is so fast, the UI feels like it's thinking *with* you, rather than processing *for* you.

### Cline: "Vibe Coding"

We practiced "Vibe Coding" — focusing on high-level logic and UX "vibe" while Cline handled the heavy lifting.

- **Rapid Prototyping**: We used Cline to scaffold the entire Electron + React + Vite monorepo structure in minutes, not hours.
- **Refactoring**: When we changed our mind about the design (switching from a sidebar to a floating spotlight search style), Cline refactored the Tailwind classes across multiple files instantly.
- **Learnings**: Providing Cline with a "Context" screen of our current file structure helped it make smarter decisions about where to place new components.

## Challenges Faced

During the intense 24-hour hackathon, we encountered a few rate-limiting hurdles:

1. We initially faced rate limit issues with Cerebras inference. These were later resolved by the Cerebras team, who generously increased the allowed rate limit for hackathon participants to 25M tokens.
2. We also ran into rate limit issues with Cline. The Cline team quickly addressed this for all hackathon participants and additionally introduced us to their new IDE extension, which proved very helpful during development.

Huge thanks to both the Cerebras and Cline teams for their fast support — it was critical to getting the project finished on time.

## What It Does

- **Instant Wake**: Double-tap `Option` (or your custom bind) to summon it. No clicks required.
- **Context Vision**: Captures your active window or full screen instantly. No file uploads needed.
- **Smart Actions**:
  - **Debug**: Segfault? Just invoke FlickAI. It reads the stack trace and suggests a fix.
  - **Draft**: Staring at a blank reply? It reads the email thread and drafts a response in your tone.
  - **Summarize**: Meeting notes on screen? It organizes them into action items.
- **Voice Mode**: Don't want to type? Just speak. Integrated **Deepgram** for near-instant transcription.
